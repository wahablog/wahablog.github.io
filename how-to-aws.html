          <h2 class="section-heading">The Move to the Cloud</h2>
         <p>As more organizations start their Public Cloud Adoption journey, 
           chances are they will either be migrating existing APIs/applications to the cloud, and even
           building new ones. If you are looking into leveraging AWS, you want to make
           sure that you choose the right technical stack to build your APIs/applications. 
         </p>
         <p>
          AWS is like a huge candy store, with ~100+ available services to choose from for building applications.
          As a responsible developer, you want to make sure that you identify the pros and cons of each particular
          AWS service (aspects like: integration with other applications/platforms, availability, pricing, future growth/scalability options, 
          permissions, etc.). 

          <p>These are aspects you should address as early as possible, before drafting out any sort of architectural design models,
            or writing any code. Addressing these concerns initially will help enable you to have highly-reliable APIs/applications
            in the future that will help grow your business. 
          </p>
         </p>  

          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 0: Know your Business and Customer Requirements</h2>
  
        
          <p>This step is of utmost importance while considering AWS. Before you pick any AWS service, you need to know your business and customer requirements. 
          </p>
            <p>Some important considerations include:</p> 

            <ul>
              <li>The Business flows your API/service will support (example: submit requests, update/store information, etc.) </li>
              <li>The Customer group - who executes those business processes/flows and where from? (example: humain interaction, clients, different frameworks/applications) </li>
              <li>Knowing what is the recurrence of every flow? (example 2000 requests per every hour, 100 assignments everyday, etc.)</li>
              <li>Understanding the business impacts via quantifiable metrics, if for example, any of these flows quit working or malfunction for: 1 moment, 5 minutes, 60 minutes, 8 hours, 24 hours? 
              </li>
            </ul>

            Having the answers to the customer points will give you the correct setting to decide on potential AWS services.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 1: Consider Performance and Future Scalability</h2>
          <p> This can be an expensive erro if not given proper and thorough considerations. 
            Applications are meant to grow over a period of time, either through additional 
            calling applications, or added features. Although in the early stages it can be difficult 
            to preciesly pinpoint what numerically the amount of resources/VMs to allocate to a partircular application, 
            it's always safe to consider the following points:
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="section">Is the service scalable?</h3>
          <p>
            While assessing a specific AWS service, try to pinpoint those AWS resources or confugration settings that will help drive scale for your applications. 
            This will enable you to begin with the correct limit with regards to each AWS resource, and develop a procedure in place to scale your AWS infrastructure as your application's utilization develops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Scaling examples: #of Provisioned EC2 instances, Dynamo DB capacity units, Lambda function concurrency, RDS read replicas, Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache cluster size, etc.
          </p>

          <h3 class="section">Are there resource utilization limits?</h3>
          <p>
            AWS can appear like this infinite source of computing power, but there are limits. Specifically, limits applied to your account.
          </p>
            <p>Here are examples of some resource limit dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Number of provisioned resources (example: EC2 instances, SQS queues, CloudWatch Alarms, IAM Roles/Users, S3 Buckets, VPCs)</li>
             <li>Data retention periods (example: CloudWatch metric logs, Kinesis streams, SQS message retention)</li> 
             <li>Throughput (example: concurrent Lambda executions, CloudWatch List/Describe/Put requests, SNS messages per second, Dynamo DB capacity units, EFS throughput in Gb/s)</li> 
             <li>Payload size (example: SQS messages, Dynamo DB items, Kinesis records, IoT messages, IAM policy size)</li>
             <li>Storage size (example: EBS volume size)</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that some limits can be increased (for example, number of EC2 instances you can launch), while others cannot (for example, metric retention in CloudWatch). You need to ensure that there are no deal breakers for your application in the “cannot be increased” category.</li>
          </ul>            
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 2: Think about Availability</h2>
          <p>AWS has a pretty solid engineering support team that is always ready to prevent and fix all sorts of failure scenarios. 
            But, failures in the AWS services will occur from time to time. 
            You want to minimize the risk of lost revenue for your company, therefore you have to consider the options a specific AWS service gives you in order to properly handle failure. 
            
            <p>It is also worth noting how difficult it is to set up those mechanisms. But totally worth it in the future.</p>

            <h3 class="section">What are some possible failure scenarios?</h3>
            <p>At a high-level, these are some types of failure situations you may have to deal with for a particular service:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cannot access existing AWS services - (example: unable view existing S3 Buckets, can't describe EC2 instances, increased latency due to high numbers of failures on an API</li>
              <li>Cannot create new/additional AWS resources - (example: facing increased error rates and latency while launching EC2 instances)</li>
              <li>Failing connectivity within Availability Zones - (example: connectivity errors and/or increased rate of latency between EC2 instances in different/same Availability Zones, higher rates of errors between RDS master record and read replicas)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before settling on a service, I suggest examining the common failure scenarios of a particular AWS service, and incorporating the recovery strategies into your proposed design.
              The <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">AWS Service Health Dashboard</a> is a good place to view the current status, as well as history of all AWS services region-wide. 
              This will help you undertand the history of particular services, and the failures that have occurred in the past so you can be well-informed.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section">How to mitigate some failure scenarios?</h3>
            <p>Use failover mechanisms to bring up your backup/redundant AWS resources online. Examples
              are: Using Application Load Balancing to deploy traffic to healthy instances, using health checks,
              Autoscaling groups for EC2 instances, and Backup-region routing in case of Route53 DNS failures.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section">Backup and Redundancy Measures</h3>
            <p>Redundancy enables you to have a backup (or additional set )of your AWS resources
              that will kick in when there are failures. Examples are: Having a fleet of additional EC2
            instances ready for traffic, replicated data in S3 (or even S3 versioning-enabled buckets), 
            RDS Read Replicas as mirror databases, and Cross-region data replication in DynamoDB. </p>

          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 3: Security</h2>
          <p>AWS provides a number of different methods to give you control and ensure your AWS resources and data are accessed and stored in a secure manner. 
             IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the key and global method for authentication and permissions management in AWS. 
             Aside from this one, there are also additional mechanisms and tools that vary by service.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section">Create resource-based permission policies</h3>
          <h3 class="section">Enable CloudTrail</h3>
          <h3 class="section">Encrypt your Data</h3>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 4: Proactive Monitoring</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3 class="section">Enable CloudWatch monitoring</h3>
          <h3 class="section">Appropriately managing incidents</h3>
          <h3 class="section">Deployment methods and practices</h3>

          <p></p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Step 5: Know your Costs</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3 class="section">Identify AWS price dimensions relevant to your application and AWS service</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h3 class="section">Identify and calculate price at scale</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h3 class="section">Compare pricing in ALL AWS Regions for a particular AWS service</h3>
