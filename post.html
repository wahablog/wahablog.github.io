         <p>At my job we have been working on re-platforming our single-page app for the past few months, and we're leveraging  
         Amazon Web Services for rapid development. This is my first AWS project, so it's a lot to take in. 
         That process is going well, but there are still many services I haven't even touched on. 
         
         <p>Then I heard Amazon was hosting a AWS Summit in Atlanta, I decided to attend and see what I could learn and bring back to my team.
         Since there are more summits scheduled this year (and presumably ongoing),
         I'm writing to share my learnings, experience, and to help anyone considering a future Summit.</p>  
         If you're attending an AWS Summit near you, or on the fence about it,
         read on to see what to expect and get some tips around planning.</p>

          <p>The keynote speech was delivered by Sandy Carter (Vice President of AWS Enterprise Workloads). 
            Sandy focuses on helping various companies use and maximize AWS services to the fullest 
            from an innovation perspective. Before that, she used to work at IBM. She is the author of 
            Extreme Innovation: Three Superpowers for Purpose and Profit, and an adjunct professor at 
            Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley.
          </p>

          <p>Sandy shared with us all valuable insights into how organizations around the world are
            embracing AWS technology at a 'supersonic' pace. This is all due to the rapid development and deploy capabilities 
            AWS offers, copuled with the high customer-demand and need of an immediate feedback loop for any given
            product/service. She pointed out that companies that offer Software-as-a-Service (Saas) are the 
            key companies that AWS has benefited (Splunk, Dynatrace, and Pega) to name a few. 
         </p>

          <h3 class="section-heading">The Keynote - Technical Notes</h2>
          <p>From a technical perspective, the AWS services most utilized by companies is Lambda. 
            Lambda is the most widely-used service in AWS, followed by S3, EC2, and Elastic Blockstore (EBS).
            Lambda and API Gateway are mostly used for building Microservices. Lambda funcions are all event-driven.
            A subset of Lambda functions are also Step Functions. 
            A new service AWS has recent launched is the Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database). It is a
            fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and 	cryptographically verifiable transaction log. 
            Owned by a central trusted authority.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Lab Time - Intro to EC2</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
